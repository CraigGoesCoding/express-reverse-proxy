# express-reverse-proxy

The Express reverse proxy I wrote in my YouTube video "[How to Fix The Cors Error with a Reverse Proxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jPoTpXpIH4&t=796)"

This is a slightly cleaned up version, so is a little different from the video. As I mentioned, I've refactored the query string code in to its own class and made a couple of other improvements.

## Usage:

Clone the repo, then from the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

`node app.js`

You can then access the server on port 3000:

`http://localhost:3000`
